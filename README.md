# PIPOVIM
Welcome to my personal Vim configuration! This repository contains my `.vimrc` file, designed to enhance the Vim editing experience with a focus on modern development, auto-completion, and navigation.

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Curl**: Needed to install `vim-plug`.
* **Node.js & npm/yarn**: Essential for `coc.nvim` and its language server extensions. You can install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **FZF CLI**: The `fzf.vim` plugin requires the `fzf` command-line tool. You will install it as part of the plugin setup, but it's good to be aware.

### Features
This configuration sets up Vim with several quality-of-life improvements:

- **Search Improvements**: incsearch incrementally highlights matches as you type, making searching more intuitive.
- **Smart Auto-Closing**: Automatically closes common pairs like quotes, parentheses, brackets, and angle brackets, and positions the cursor inside them (inoremap for `''`, `""`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `<>`).

### Plugins
This configuration leverages `vim-plug` to manage a set of powerful plugins:

| Plugin | Description |

| `tpope/vim-sensible` | A collection of common-sense Vim options that just make Vim feel better. |

### Usage & Keybindings

* **Auto-Completion**: The configuration sets up `TAB` for navigating completion suggestions and `Shift-TAB` for going backwards.
* **Code Actions (Coc.nvim)**:
  * `leader` + `a` (normal mode): Trigger code actions at the cursor.
  * `leader` + `a` (visual mode): Trigger code actions for the selected text.
    (Assuming `<leader>` is set to `\` by default, or whatever you have configured.)
